    <h2>The City Changes</h2>
    <p>
        The city softens at night. Shadows stretch, streetlights hum, and windows glow like quiet beacons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reflections shimmer on rain-slick pavement. The hum of distant traffic becomes a lullaby for those awake.
    </p>

    <h2>The People</h2>
    <p>
        Some move with purpose, others drift without urgency. The city transforms them, and they transform it in return.
    </p>

    <h3>WANDERERS</h3>
    <p>
        They trace the edges of light and shadow, noticing the details daylight hides.
    </p>

    <h3>OBSERVATIONS AFTER MIDNIGHT</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flickering neon reflected on wet sidewalks</li>
        <li>Steam rising from subway grates</li>
        <li>Quiet windows glowing in high-rise apartments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>After Hours</h2>
    <p>
        The night does not hide the city. It reveals layers invisible in daylight. Every shadow, every light, every reflection becomes a story.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traffic slows, the air hums with quiet energy. Alleyways whisper of journeys begun and journeys paused. The city is both still and alive.
    </p>
    <p>
        When morning returns, it does not erase the night. It layers another narrative on top, but the echoes remain for those who listen.
